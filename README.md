**coloredstrings** is a small utility for expressive terminal colors and text styles.
It exposes a fluent, chainable API for styling strings and can act as a drop-in replacement for similar packages like [yachalk](https://github.com/bluenote10/yachalk).

Designed to be suitable, useful, and "batteries-included".

Example:

```python
import coloredstrings as cs

print(cs.bold.underline.red("Error:"), "Something went wrong.")
print(cs.blue.bold("Info:"), "Everything is OK")
print(cs.italic.green("Success!"))
```

## Features🔥

- No dependencies
- Composing styles in a chainable way: `black.on.white.bold("What's up?")`
- Nested colors and no nested styling bug
- Support for 16-color, 256-color, and 24-bit (truecolor / RGB / hex) modes
- Auto-detection of terminal color capabilities
- Automatically fallback to the nearest supported color if the requested color isn't supported

- Call any of [named true colors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#named-colors) as a method: `aqua`, `pink` and so on
- Extend default styles with user-defined ones
- Strip ANSI escape codes with `strip_ansi`
- Friendly to [CLI arguments](#cli-arguments): `--color` & `--no-color`
- Support for [common envs](#force_color-no_color-clicolor_force-and-clicolor): [`FORCE_COLOR`](https://force-color.org/), [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/), [`CLICOLOR_FORCE` & `CLICOLOR`](https://bixense.com/clicolors/)
- Curious how **coloredstrings** compares to other libraries? See [Migrating from other libraries](#migrating-from-other-libraries)

## Installation

Stable release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install coloredstrings
```

Latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/samedit66/coloredstrings.git
```

---

## Quick start

Run the bundled demo:

```bash
python -m coloredstrings
```

Features:

```python
import coloredstrings as cs

print(cs.bold.underline.red("Error:"), "Something went wrong.")
print(cs.blue.bold("Info:"), "Everything is OK")
print(cs.italic.green("Success!"))

# styles accepts multiple arguments and a `sep` argument like `print`:
print(cs.green("That's", "great!"))
print(cs.blue(1, 3.14, True, sep=", "))

# Nesting and combining styles:
print(cs.red(f"Hello {cs.underline.on.blue('world')}!"))
print(
    cs.green(
        "I am a green line "
        + cs.blue.underline.bold("with a blue substring")
        + " that becomes green again!"
    )
)

# 24-bit RGB / hex and 256-color:
print(cs.rgb(123, 45, 200)("custom"))
print(cs.rgb("#aabbcc")("hex is also supported"))
print(cs.rgb("purple")("as well as named colors too"))
print(cs.rgb((169, 169, 169))("tuples can also be used"))
print(cs.color256(37)("256-color example"))

# Define theme helpers:
error = cs.bold.red
warning = cs.rgb("#FFA500")

print(error("Error!"))
print(warning("Warning!"))

# Or extend with your own styles:
bootstrap = cs.extend(
    primary="blue",            # may be a color / style name
    secondary=(169, 169, 169), # RGB-tuple color
    success=cs.green,          # or any `StyleBuilder` instance
)

print(bootstrap.primary("Click me!"))
print(bootstrap.italic.secondary("You can combine builtin styles with your own!"))
print(bootstrap.success("Complete."))
```

---

## Usage

Import `coloredstrings` module directly:

```python
from coloredstrings import white, red, blue

print(white.bold("white bold text"))
print(red("just red text"))
print(blue.strikethrough("blue strikethrough text"))
```

Or use only needed styles:

```python
import coloredstrings as cs

print(cs.green.on.pink("green text on pink background"))
```

Chainable API allows you to easily compose styles and use them. When passing final text to a style, you can pass multiple objects which will be turned to strings and joined using an optional `sep` argument (which defaults to a single space):

```python
import coloredstrings as cs

print(cs.orange("text", 1, 1.0, True, sep="-"))
```

### `StyleBuilder`

Although you use `cs` everywhere, the actual work is done by an immutable `StyleBuilder` class under the hood. Because every style object is immutable, creating a new style from an existing one doesn't modify the original. This avoids accidental cross-contamination of styles present in `yachalk`:

```python
from yachalk import chalk
import coloredstrings as cs

# With yachalk
s1 = chalk.italic
s2 = s1.red

print(s1("Chalk, am I red?"))
print(s2("Yes, you are!"))

print("-" * 8)

# With coloredstrings
s3 = cs.italic
s4 = s3.red

print(s3("Style, am I still red?"))
print(s4("Sure not, but I am!"))
```

![yachalk bug image](https://github.com/samedit66/coloredstrings/blob/main/media/yachalk_bug.png?raw=true)

In this example, `s1/s2` and `s3/s4` behave differently: `s1/s2` are actually the same style, while `s3/s4` are truly independent styles.

### Chaining and gotchas

`coloredstrings` — like `yachalk` and several other libraries — is built around chaining styles. Unlike some libraries, it does not provide separate background helpers such as `bg_blue`. Instead, use the `on` helper to mark that the next color in the chain should be a background color. This gives you explicit control over whether the color you add applies to the foreground or the background.

Example:

```python
import coloredstrings as cs

# Red text on a blue background
print(cs.red.on.blue("Hey!"))

# Don't write code like this - it's hard to read!
# It's equivalent to `cs.white.on.black(...)` but much less clear
print(cs.white.on.on.black("Do not write code like that."))

# Green background with default foreground
print(cs.on.green("Text on a green background"))
```

A few important gotchas:

- If you chain multiple foreground colors, only the last foreground color takes effect:

  ```python
  print(cs.red.green.blue("Blue text")) # result: blue foreground
  ```

- `on` affects only the next color in the chain. For example:

  ```python
  print(cs.on.magenta.cyan("Cyan text on magenta background"))
  ```

  Here `magenta` becomes the background (because of `on`) and `cyan` is the foreground.

- Repeated calls to `on` without an intervening color are redundant and hurt readability; prefer the simpler, clearer form.

### Supported color modes

`coloredstrings` tries its best to detect terminal color capabilities automatically (see `coloredstrings.color_support.detect_color_support()`), but detection can occasionally miss. You can explicitly set the color mode using the pseudo-style method `color_mode(mode)`.

`mode` is a member of the `coloredstrings.ColorMode` enum with these values:
- `ColorMode.NO_COLORS` - disable styling; no escape sequences are emitted
- `ColorMode.ANSI_16` - 16 basic ANSI colors
- `ColorMode.EXTENDED_256` - 256 color mode
- `ColorMode.TRUE_COLOR` - 24-bit RGB / truecolor support

Example:

```python
from coloredstrings import style, ColorMode

# Notice `style`? It's a default style which does nothing.

# Force no colors
just_text = style.color_mode(ColorMode.NO_COLORS)
print(just_text.red("It isn't red"))

# Force truecolor
rgb_default = style.color_mode(ColorMode.TRUE_COLOR)
print(rgb_default.hex("#ca7e8d")("Hi!"))
```

#### `FORCE_COLOR`, `NO_COLOR`, `CLICOLOR_FORCE` and `CLICOLOR`

With a wide variety of options to force terminal color or not, `coloredstrings` respects common environment conventions (in order of precedence - higher precedence goes first):

- **`FORCE_COLOR`**: if set, this variable can be used to force color output even when detection would otherwise disable it (for example, when output is being piped).
Following values are supported:
  - `FORCE_COLOR<=0` - same as `ColorMode.NO_COLOR` or `NO_COLOR` environment variable
  - `FORCE_COLOR=1` - same as `ColorMode.ANSI_16`
  - `FORCE_COLOR=2` - same as `ColorMode.EXTENDED_256`
  - `FORCE_COLOR>=3` - same as `ColorMode.TRUE_COLOR`

- **`NO_COLOR`**: if this environment variable is present (with any value other than an empty string), coloredstrings will avoid emitting color escape sequences. This is the community-standard way for users to opt out of colored output.

- **`CLICOLOR_FORCE`**: same as `FORCE_COLOR`.

- **`CLICOLOR`**: same as `ColorMode.ANSI_16`.

You can still programmatically override detection by calling `style.color_mode(...)` as shown above.

#### CLI arguments

> [!NOTE]
> CLI arguments take precedence over any environment variable.

You can also specify command-line flags like `--no-color` to disable colors and `--color` to enable them.

Example with a file `cool.py`:

```python
import coloredstrings as cs

print(cs.red(f"Hello {style.blue('world')}!"))
```

```bash
# Run with python
python cool.py --no-color

# Run with uv
uv run cool.py --color
```

## Fallback behavior

Many terminals do not support full truecolor (`ColorMode.TRUE_COLOR`). When a requested color cannot be represented in the current color mode, `coloredstrings` automatically maps the requested color into the best available color space and emits the closest supported color. In short: you will still get colored output, though the result may be an approximation of the original color.

## Styles

### Attributes

- `reset` - Reset the current style chain. Widely supported.
- `bold` - Make the text bold (increases weight). Widely supported.
- `dim` (aliases: `faint`, `dark`) - Render the text with lower intensity / brightness. Support varies.
- `italic` - Render text in italic. *Support varies across terminals.*
- `underline` - Draw a horizontal line **below** the text. *Support varies.*
- `double_underline` - Draw a double underline under the text. *Not widely supported.*
- `overline` - Draw a horizontal line **above** the text. *Not widely supported.*
- `inverse` (alias: `reverse`) - Swap foreground and background colors (invert colors).
- `hidden` (alias: `concealed`) - Do not display the text (it is still present in the output stream).
- `strike` (alias: `strikethrough`) - Draw a horizontal line through the center of the text. *Support varies.*
- `blink` (alias: `slow_blink`) - Make the text blink. **Often unsupported** in modern terminals; avoid depending on it.
- `rapid_blink` - Faster blink. **Often unsupported** in modern terminals; avoid depending on it.
- `framed` - Draw a frame around the text. *Rarely supported.*
- `encircle` (alias: `circle`) - Draw a circle/encircle the text. *Rarely supported.*
- `visible` - Show text only when a color mode is enabled (anything other than `ColorMode.NO_COLOR`). Mainly used for cosmetic things.

> **Note on attributes:** Most attributes stack (they combine instead of overriding). Terminal support for many of these attributes is spotty - prefer basic attributes (`bold`, `underline`, `inverse`) for portability.

### Colors (both foreground and background)

- `black`
- `red`
- `green`
- `yellow`
- `blue`
- `magenta`
- `cyan`
- `white`
- `bright_black` (aliases: `gray`, `grey`)
- `bright_red`
- `bright_green`
- `bright_yellow`
- `bright_blue`
- `bright_magenta`
- `bright_cyan`
- `bright_white`
- `color256(index)` - 256 color
- `rgb(r, g, b)`, `rgb(hex)`, `rgb(color_name)` - 24-bit RGB color

When you call `cs` with a method not defined above, it tries to interpret the method name as a [named color](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#named-colors).
This allows having many color methods without the need to define them explicitly:

```python
import coloredstrings as cs
from coloredstrings import purple

print(cs.lavender("`lavender` is not defined internally"))
print(purple("Neither is `purple`."))
```

## Migrating from other libraries

If you’ve used other Python color or formatting libraries before, `coloredstrings` will feel familiar but more robust and consistent. Below is a quick comparison of how it differs from popular alternatives:

### **colorama**
- **colorama** provides low-level ANSI control and Windows compatibility but lacks a fluent API.
- `coloredstrings` supports more colors, styles and requires no use of ANSI codes directly.
- Example:
  ```python
  # colorama
  from colorama import Fore, Style
  print(Fore.RED + 'Error' + Style.RESET_ALL)

  # coloredstrings
  import coloredstrings as cs
  print(cs.red('Error'))
  ```

### **termcolor**
- **termcolor** focuses on basic named colors but doesn’t support chaining or RGB.
- `coloredstrings` supports truecolor, background colors, attributes, and chaining.
- Example:
  ```python
  # termcolor
  from termcolor import colored
  print(colored('Warning!', 'yellow', attrs=['bold']))

  # coloredstrings
  import coloredstrings as cs
  print(cs.bold.yellow('Warning!'))
  ```
- `coloredstrings` lacks nested styling bug presented in **termcolor**:
  ```python
  # termcolor
  from termcolor import colored
  print(colored('Warning!', 'yellow', attrs=['bold']))

  # coloredstrings
  import coloredstrings as cs
  print(cs.bold.yellow('Warning!'))
  ```

### **yachalk**
- **yachalk** inspired `coloredstrings`, but its mutable style builders can cause side effects.
- `coloredstrings`’s `StyleBuilder` is **immutable**, ensuring no cross-contamination between styles.
- Chain syntax and API are nearly identical expect that you don't need to remember a separate method for background coloring.
- Example:
  ```python
  # yachalk
  from yachalk import chalk
  print(chalk.blue.bg_red.bold("Hello world!"))

  # coloredstrings
  import coloredstrings as cs
  print(cs.blue.on.red.blod("Hello world!"))
  ```

### **rich**
- **rich** is a full-featured library for terminal formatting, tables, markdown, and logging.
- It’s excellent for large applications but too heavy for simple coloring.
- `coloredstrings` aims to be **minimal, dependency-free, and Pythonic** for everyday terminal styling.
- Example:
  ```python
  # rich
  from rich.console import Console
  Console().print('[bold red]Error[/bold red] Something went wrong')

  # coloredstrings
  import coloredstrings as cs
  print(cs.bold.red('Error:'), 'Something went wrong')
  ```

In short:
| Library | No dependencies | Chainable | Truecolor | Immutable Styles | No nested styling bug | Focus |
|----------|---------------|------------|-------------|------------------|----|----|
| colorama | ✅  | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Compatibility |
| termcolor | ✅  | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Simplicity |
| yachalk | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Modern styling |
| rich | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full-featured UI |
| **coloredstrings** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Lightweight styling |
